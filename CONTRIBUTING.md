Contributing
============

Contributions are welcome.  If you find an issue with the code or would like to
add a feature, please open an issue before beginning to code (it's also totally
fine to just open an issue for others to handle if you don't want to code
yourself).

As usual, to contribute first fork the repository and then clone your fork:
```bash
$ git clone git@github.com:YOUR_USERNAME/rget
```

In the download directory, make your changes to the code and compile them:
```bash
$ cargo build
```

Test your changes and ensure you didn't break anything, then commit them with
[descriptive commit messages](http://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/).  After
you finish working on your code, push to your fork:
```bash
$ git push
```

When everything's on GitHub,
[submit a pull request](https://github.com/Arcterus/rget/compare/).  How
quickly you receive a response on the pull request will be subject to whether
or not the maintainer(s) (a.k.a.
[Arcterus/Alex Lyon](https://github.com/Arcterus)) are available at the moment.
